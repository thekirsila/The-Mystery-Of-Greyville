The cheater's way to speedrun:

!!!NOTE: The game is designed to only work in the command-line version, not the GUI!!!

1. get out of the house (visiting the robinsons gives you access to a map, might be useful)
2. Go east until you reach the crossroads
 - At this point the player should go first completely east and find a map by the gate, but this is not required
3. Go south until you find the townhall, there is a key (and goblins) inside
4. The key fits a gate, which is found when you eastward from the crossroads
5. Go east until you find the roundabout and after that go west until you find the cabin
6. Talk to the man in the cabin and say "quest" to receive a quest
7. Go to the school, third floor, end of the hallway
8. Talk to the girl
9. Go back to the cabin
10. Talk to the man and mention quest at some point, you should get a key
11. Go back to the school, first floor, room 105, you will find corrosive
12. Use the corrosive to open the door right beside room 105
13. Boss battle.
14. Victory

!!!There is also a hidden room in the 2nd floor of the school, behind a painting!!!
